The game here on is pretty straightforward
- The goal is to generate the largest number by sheer luck
- The account whose turn it is to play is allowed to click the "Spin the Roulette wheel" button
- Once he clicks the button, a random number is generated via the commit-reveal scheme
- The winning number is updated if this number is the largest yet. 
- There is 30 second deadline before he loses his turn
- If he loses his turn, anybody but him can "Skip Turn" for him
- When everyone is done playing, the winner is declared and everyone can withdraw their winnings

## ⚔️ Side Quests

#### 🐟 Integrate L2 solutions for ETH
While playing a game, the ETH network often feels slow, integrate a L2 solution like MATIC (this one’s already done for you, try others)

#### 💰 Redesign the rewards system 
Currently the user gets heavily penalised if he misses a turn, be more kind to your players or they might not come back 😢

---

#### 🔶 Infura

> You will need to get a key from [infura.io](https://infura.io) and paste it into `constants.js` in `packages/react-app/src`:
