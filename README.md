> Use the faucet wallet to send your multi-sig contract some funds:

This will take you to a populated transaction create page:

> Create & sign the new transaction:

You will see the new transaction in the pool (this is all off-chain):

> Give your account some gas at the faucet and execute the transaction

The transction will appear as "executed" on the front page:

> Create a transaction to open a stream to your frontend account:

Again, this will take you to a populated transaction form:

This time we will need a second signature:

> Sign the transacton with enough owners:

(You'll notice you don't need ⛽️gas to sign transactions.)

> Execute the transction to open the stream:

The stream will live update with each new block mined:

(You might need to trigger a new block by sending yourself some faucet funds or something. HartHat blocks only get mined when there is a transaction.)

> Click the button any time and it will withdraw:
